CC-BY-SA Licensing for Chess Pieces, with one additional 
request: If you take the pieces and force them to change 
affiliation, please reflect this by changing colors. 

Explicitly: I do not want the yellow / orange color set 
playing in F*B's Meta. I'm sure their hacker crew can 
figure out another palette or their own shapes. 

The trees... So far there are too few to do ML, but making 
more similar could be a meta goal. 

The Mandapams... Have to do with Elsewhere, don't worry, 
you'll figure it out if you just keep working.

Have more fun & games & puzzles if necessary!

Happy Holidays!
